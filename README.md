<h2>CMPS 390, Data Structures, Assignment 4 2nd Linked List program</h2>

<strong>Read the following program spec completely before you start.</strong>

You are to write a program that reads a data file of first and last names and inserts them into a list in alphabetical order, based on the last name.  Your program should have the following functionality:

<pre>
•	Ask user for file name to read from
•	Read in names from the file, names.txt
•	Names should be inserted in the appropriate place (alphabetically)
•	Do not presort the list
•	Have menu options (just text using a console application) to do the following:
•	Display the list.
•	Request the length of the list
•	The user should be able to delete a single name from the list.
•	Request the length of a section of the list. (How many people have a name that starts with “B”)
•	Also your program should be able to print out sections of names, for example it should be able to print all peoples names that start with an “A”, “B”, etc. 
•	 To do so, you need to make an index that has links into your list for each letter of the alphabet.  If there are no entries for a particular letter, your link should point to NULL and if those names are requested, your program should inform the user.

 
<strong>Code requirements</strong>
1.	You must have separate functions for each list operation (i.e insert, empty, delete, etc.)  Make your own functions, do not use built in functions from JAVA, C++, etc.
2.	No GUI’s required, concentrate on the functionality.
3.	JAVA or C/C variant
4.	No fancy built in types will be accepted.  Make your own structures, your own functions, etc.
